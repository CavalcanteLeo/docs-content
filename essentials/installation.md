# Installation

FormKit can be downloaded using a package manager like `npm` or `yarn` or it can be used directly via CDN.

## With Vue

Most new projects use a build tool like Vite, Snowpack, or webpack. This makes installing npm dependencies a piece of cake üç∞.

<client-only>
```sh
npm install @formkit/vue
```
</client-only>

The `@formkit/vue` package ships with a Vue plugin and a default configuration for easy setup.

<client-only>

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from 'App.vue'
import { plugin, defaultConfig } from '@formkit/vue'

createApp(App).use(plugin, defaultConfig).mount('#app')
```
</client-only>

<callout type="tip" label="Default theme">
If you‚Äôd like to install Genesis ‚Äî the default FormKit theme ‚Äî please follow the installation instructions on <a href="/essentials/styling">the styling documentation</a>.
</callout>

That's it! You're now ready to use the `<FormKit>` component in your Vue application. The `defaultConfig` includes all of FormKit's inputs, validation rules, and the English language. You can replace the `defaultConfig` with your own configuration, which allows for improved tree-shaking (only include the rules and languages you want to actually use) and more fine-grained control.

<callout type="warning" label="Vue 2">
FormKit only supports Vue 3. If you're required to use Vue 2 on a project, consider using the spiritual ancestor of FormKit ‚Äî <a href="https://vueformulate.com" target="_blank">Vue Formulate</a>.
</callout>

## With Nuxt

Using FormKit with Nuxt requires minimal setup. First include the Nuxt module as a dependency within your project:

<client-only>
```sh
npm install @formkit/nuxt
```
</client-only>

Then in your `nuxt.config` file add the module to your modules list:

<client-only>

```js
// nuxt.config
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt3'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@formkit/nuxt'
  ]
})
```
</client-only>

That's it! FormKit is now registered in your project using the default config and you can start using the `<FormKit>` component.

### Configuring with Nuxt
If you would like to supply your own configuration, create a `formkit.config` file adjacent to your `nuxt.config` file. Like the `nuxt.config` file itself, `.ts`, `.mjs`, and `.js` are all valid file extensions depending on your project's needs:

<client-only>
```sh
myProject/
|- formkit.config.ts
|- nuxt.config.ts
```
</client-only>

This configuration file will be automatically included if detected in your project directory. If you would like to supply a custom
path to your `formkit.config`, you can override the default location using the `configFile` option under the `formkit` key.
**Any path you supply should be relative to the root of your Nuxt project**.

<client-only>

```js
// nuxt.config
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt3'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@formkit/nuxt'
  ],
  formkit: {
    configFile: './my/custom/location/formkit.config.ts'
  }
})
```
</client-only>

By default, your configuration will *extend* the `defaultConfig` that ships with FormKit. This is the desired behavior
for the majority of projects. However, if you need to define the entire FormKit config yourself ‚Äî from scratch ‚Äî you may do so
by setting the `defaultConfig` option for the module to `false`:

<client-only>

```js
// nuxt.config
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt3'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@formkit/nuxt'
  ],
  formkit: {
    defaultConfig: false,
    configFile: './my/custom/location/formkit.config.ts'
    // ^ this is now a full config replacement, not override.
  }
})
```
</client-only>

That's it! FormKit is ready to use and ‚Äî if you read this far ‚Äî specifically tailored to your Nuxt project's needs.

<callout type="warning" label="Nuxt 2">
FormKit only supports Nuxt 3. If you're required to use Nuxt 2 on a project, consider using the spiritual ancestor of FormKit ‚Äî <a href="https://vueformulate.com" target="_blank">Vue Formulate</a> ‚Äî which also ships with its own Nuxt module.

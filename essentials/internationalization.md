# Internationalization (i18n)

FormKit ships with internationalization support for all of itâ€™s interfaces and validation messages. Currently, FormKit supports the following languages (in the `@formkit/i18n` package):

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German (de)
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English (en)
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French (fr)

<callout type="info" label="Flags arenâ€™t languages">
Although flags are <a href="http://www.flagsarenotlanguages.com/blog/why-flags-do-not-represent-language/">poor representations of languages</a> (flags indicate a geographic nation, while languages can be spoken in many ares of the world), we use the flags in the list above to indicate the location of the contributor who created that particular locale.

## Using a locale

FormKitâ€™s `defaultConfig` includes the english locale by default â€” to add an additional locale, import it from `@formkit/i18n` and append it to the `locales` option when you initialized the FormKit plugin. To set the active locale specify it with the `locale` option:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from 'App.vue'
import { plugin, defaultConfig } from '@formkit/vue'
import { de, fr, zh } from '@formkit/i18n'

const app = createApp(App)
app.use(
  plugin,
  defaultConfig({
    // Define additional locales
    locales: { de, fr, zh },
    // Define the active locale
    locale: 'fr',
  })
)
app.mount('#app')
```

<!-- ## Changing the active locale

There are two ways to change your active locale:

- Using `this.$formkit.setLocale()` from the Vue plugin.
- Directly modifying the root `config` object.

### Using `setLocale`

When using Vueâ€™s options API you have access to `this.$formkit` which contains a purpose-built method `setLocale()` which globally changes the current locale. -->

## Adding your language

Writing a locale for your own native language is a great way to contribute to FormKit, and an easy way to get started with open source too! We are always eager to see pull requests for new locales. To support this effort weâ€™ve created a small web app to help make the translation process as easy as possible.

<cta href="https://i18n.formkit.com" label="Help others who speak your language!" button="Contribute a locale"></cta>

Of course, you are not required to use our locale builder to submit a language, and you are more than welcome to submit a standard pull request with your locale included.

<callout type="info" label="Localization">
If your language is already on the list (lets say English), but your locality speaks a variation of that language (like ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ <code>en-GB</code>), please feel free to submit your localized language.

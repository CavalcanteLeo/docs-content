# Community

Community involvement and contributions are one of the most important aspects of the FormKit ecosystem. We invite you to actively participate — whether using FormKit's products, translating validation messages to your native tongue, being an active member of the Discord, or filing bug reports or making pull requests to the [FormKit codebase](https://github.com/formkit/formkit).

## Get involved

### FormKit Discord server (generalized help & discussion)

If you're in need of more generalized help or want to make connections within the FormKit community — consider joining the official FormKit Discord (used for both FormKit and Vue Formulate — FormKit's predecessor). Over 275 developers along with the core team hang around in there. If you are not already a member (it's free and open), you'll need to use the following invite link to join the server.

### GitHub issues (bugs and features)

GitHub issues are reserved for feature requests and bug reports. If you've found a bug, please create a GitHub issue by reproducing it in the [playground](/playground/vue) and clicking the share button! Feature requests are always going to be a bit subjective, but if you believe there's a good use case that is currently under served by FormKit, we want to know.

<!-- If you have a PRO subscription, you'll be able to see and upvote feature requests from others -->

### Submit a locale

We are always looking for native speakers to submit a translation of the FormKit validation messages and UI elements. This is a great way to get involved, even with minimal coding experience. The easiest way to provide a translation is by using the locale builder:

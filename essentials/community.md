# Community

Community involvement and contributions are one of the most important aspects of the FormKit ecosystem. We invite you to actively participate — whether using FormKit's products, translating validation messages, being an active member of the Discord, or filing bug reports and making pull requests to the [FormKit codebase](https://github.com/formkit/formkit).

## Sponsorhip

FormKit will always be free and open source. If you want to help accelerate the development and maintenance of [FormKit](https://github.com/formkit/formkit), please consider [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/formkit)! In addition to our gratitude and enabling us to spend more time improving FormKit, you'll also get various perks at different tiers of sponsorship!

## Get involved

### FormKit Discord server (generalized help & discussion)

If you're in need of more generalized help or want to make connections within the community, consider joining the official FormKit Discord (used for both FormKit and Vue Formulate — FormKit's predecessor). Over 375 developers along with the core team spend time there. If you are not already a member (it's free and open), you'll need to use the following invite link to join the server.

### GitHub issues (bugs and features)

GitHub issues are reserved for feature requests and bug reports. If you've found a bug, please create a GitHub issue by reproducing it in the [playground](/playground/vue) and clicking the share button! Feature requests are always going to be a bit subjective, but if you believe there's a good use case that is currently under served by FormKit, we want to know.

<!-- If you have a PRO subscription, you'll be able to see and upvote feature requests from others -->

### Submit a locale

We are always looking for native speakers to submit a translation of the FormKit validation messages and UI elements. This is a great way to get involved, even with minimal coding experience. The easiest way to provide a translation is by using the locale builder:

### Create content to share

One of the best ways to enrich the FormKit (and Vue 3) community at large is to create content such as articles, guides, YouTube videos, or other educational content to share with others! We will be happy to include links to high-quality content in our docs.

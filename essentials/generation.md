# Generate forms

FormKit ships with first-class support for generating forms from JSON (or other JavaScript objects). This makes it possible to store generative forms in databases and files. Heck, you could put a form’s JSON a QR code if you wanted to. To generate a form, just pass that Data to the `<FormKitSchema>` component.

Let’s take a quick look at an example and we'll pick it up on the other side.

# Your first form

<page-toc></page-toc>

## Introduction

Let's start creating our first FormKit form, here we will learn some key features of FormKit, we will also see some nice tips on how to deal with the state of your form without using `v-model`, FormKit already does all the reactive stuff behind the scenes why complicate it right?

This guide assumes you are are familiar with the <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles">Vue Composition API</a>.
</callout>

## Inputs

One of the main features of FormKit is the single component API, while learning how to use a single component you will learn how to use all input types, while some may extend and add features, they will still share the base functionality of the others. If you want to know more about you can find at [inputs](/essentials/inputs).

Let's take a look at the main component, `<FormKit />`, as it is right now we already generated a great starting point for our input, with an accessible markup, a defined base `text` type, and all features that will be explained in later sections.

### Our first input

Our first input should be something simple, we will build on it little by little so we can see the importance of some FormKit features.

#### The type

Like we talked before, FormKit has only a single component `<FormKit />` and by default it will use the `type="text"` if no `type` is specified, the `type` is how we can tell what input we want, just like "native" inputs we have inputs like `text`, `select`, `checkbox` and so on, but we are also not confined to only simple "native" inputs, FormKit allows you to do much more just like our upcomings Pro Inputs. that represent "synthetic" input types with more complex behaviour:

<example
  name="First input"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/first-input/example.vue">
</example>

#### The name and id

If you take a look at the markup generated by the previous example, FormKit already created an accessible markup, but as we did not specify the `name` and `id` properties, it auto generated those for us `name="text_1" id="input_0"`, even tho FormKit created one for us, we should always specify the `name` and `id` as we will see later, it makes using inputs inside a form easier, as those are used by `form` and `group` to pass down their values to their children based on the `name`.

<example
  name="Adding name and id"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/input-name-id/example.vue">
</example>

#### Accessible texts

Our input is still missing some accessible texts like a `label`, `help`, maybe even a `placeholder`, but those are easy to add, FormKit accepts both as props to add accessible markup with a11y in mind:

<example
  name="Adding label and help texts"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/input-accessible-text/example.vue">
</example>

### Adding a default value

Some use cases may need a default value to work, if we look at an example case about a vitality bar in a character creation form for a game, we could use the `range` input with a predefined value when the users first opens the form, to make that work we can use the `value` prop to add the first initial value to the input:

<example
  name="Adding label and help texts"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/input-vitality-bar/example.vue">
</example>

### Adding validation

Validation is one of the main features of FormKit, it helps the user to know if the value they submited is correct, FormKit makes adding [validation](/essentials/validation) a breaze, with many powerful built-in `validation` rules already implemented for you, we will be using `validation` to make sure that the user is `required` to add a name, and is `not:Admin`:

<example
  name="Adding validation to name"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/input-validation/example.vue">
</example>

We should also add a `required` and `max:10` rule to our vitality input:

<client-only>

```html
<FormKit
  type="range"
  name="vitality"
  id="vitality"
  validation="required|max:10"
  label="Vitality"
  value="5"
  min="1"
  max="10"
  step="1"
  help="How much vitality points to start with"
/>
```

</client-only>

### Number casting

Our "backend" will require that our attributes like `vitality` to be [casted to number](https://formkit.link/b37c7d36263ab0ee1bd626aa0a405b93), but by default FormKit follows HTML "native" inputs behaviour making all values as "strings", so to fix that we can use one of the coolest features that FormKit has, [Plugins](/advanced/core#plugins), with plugins we can change how the value of an inputs is returned to us:

<example
  name="Adding plugin to cast to number"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/input-cast-number/example.vue">
</example>

## First Step â€” Creating the form

First, let's create a basic form so we have content to work with. Our example will be a pretend character creation form, we will add more features to it at each section, like validation, grouping, changing values based on other fields, and so on.

We will be using one of the inputs called `form`, this input will make grouping and validation of fields way easier, you just need to wrap all yours fields inside a `<FormKit type="form">`:

<callout type="info" label="Form values">
The <code>form</code> type will actively collect all the values from child inputs using the <code>name</code> of each input as a data object for you (just like <code>group</code>).
</callout>

<example
  name="Character creation form"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/character-basic-form/example.vue">
</example>

### Adding the submit handler

The first feature of a form in FormKit that we will see is that we have a `@submit` event ready to make our life easier when it comes to submiting our form, the `@submit` event gives us as the first argument all fields that the form gathered from the inputs, no need to use `v-model` for it:

<example
  name="Basic form"
  file="_content/examples/guides/your-first-form/character-form-submit/example.vue">
</example>

### Changing the submit button

As convinience when using `type="form"` the `form` outputs a submit button automatically, but for our case a "Submit" text does not show the intent of the form correctly, so to fix that we can use a nice feature that the `form` has to offer, and that is the `submit-label` prop, we can by simply adding `submit-label="Create Character"` show the intent of the form as a whole:

<client-only>

```html
<FormKit
  type="submit"
  @submit="createCharacter"
  submit-label="Create Character"
>
  <!-- Rest of our creation form -->
</FormKit>
```

</client-only>
